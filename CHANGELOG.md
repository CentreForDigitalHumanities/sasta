-   Visualize parse trees for utterances

### Fixed

-   Resolved a bug where words would be misaligned when analyzing with existing annotations

### Changed

-   Clearer error messages for parses that cannot be analysed

## [0.5.3] - 2022-07-27

### Fixed

## [0.5.2] - 2022-07-26

### Fixed

## [0.5.0] - 2022-06-28

### Fixed

-   Resolved a bug where corpora keep refreshing after leaving their page
-   Resolved several vulnerabilities in both backend and frontend

### Added

-   Implemented preprocessing steps for CHAT input files (anonymization, interpunction cleanup)
-   Separated parsed and reparsed/corrected treebanks. Admins can view them separately , both files are included in corpus downloads
-   Added comment row to annotation files, allowing free text. These are not interpreted by the analysis
-   Allows annotation in unaligned column, signifying either utterance-level or unaligned annotations

### Changed

-   Disabled method selection for non-admins. The latest method is used by default. Admins can still select older versions
-   Moved unaligned column to the first position, before word1..wordN in annotation files

## [0.4.0] - 2022-04-05

### Fixed

-   Resolved an issue where default methods were prevented from being set.
-   Some forms were not correctly updated after supplying manual corrections, e.g. ASTA WW and N. This is fixed by implementing aligned results functionality.

### Added

-   New SASTADEV method definitions.

### Changed

-   Extra corpus information and control:
    -   Overview of number of targeted utterances and targeting flags.
    -   Overview of all utterances.
    -   Shortcut to upload additional transcripts to the corpus.
-   Upload multiple files without zipping them.
-   In SASTA Output Format, lock all cells except annotation cells. This is implemented to avoid errors in manual correction files.
-   ASTA corrects Nouns and Verbs
-   use exactresults

## [0.3.2] - 2022-03-22

### Fixed

-   Resolved an issue where corrected transcripts were incorrectly analyzed.

### Fixed

-   Resolved an issue where CHAT annotations were added to the wrong utterances.

## [0.3.0] - 2022-02-07

### Added

-   Implement latest method defintions.
-   Upgrade to Python 3.7.x
-   Concurrent parsing: up to 8 transcripts can be parsed in parallel.

### Changed

-   All marked utterances are given utterance IDs, no longer use utterance numbers. Analysis now numbers utterance 1-N, where N is number of marked utterances.
-   Phase out `python-ucto`, and by proxy `ucto` (through changes in `corpus2alpino`). Severly reduces dependency complexity.

### Removed

-   Dropped Python 3.6.x support.

### Security

-   Fixed multipe vulnerabilities in backend and frontend.

## [0.2.6] - 2021-12-17

-   Updates to query definitions and related SASTADEV functions.
-   Automatic corrections on input files to improve parses of irregular language (implemented in SASTADEV).
